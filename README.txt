I organized it by Chapter. Clone this repo to your local machine and follow the guide for remote
pushes. We should all update periodically. 

My struture for Ch4 just helps me organize everything.

src contains all my code samples. This is in maven form /src/main/java and src/main/hql'
data contains the various sample datasets I need for my examples. 
recipes is the actual word doc content. 

Sources.docx is to help track which sites we need to reference. 

Eventually we'll have to delete this project when we host the code officially.
